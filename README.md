openmetro
=========
**Open** Data + Milan **Metro** = **OpenMetro**.

This is just a way to showcase what open data can be used for. Ideally it should be used to represent the whole metro map but I started with the shortest line which is working right now ([lilac line or line number 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Metro_Line_5)).

Browser issues
==============
It does not work on Opera and it looks a bit weird in Chrome (labels are far away from the circles representing metro stations). It looks fine on Firefox.

Code issues
===========
It has to be rewritten compltely from the bottom up! :) 

Data
====
I've provided a data directory where the raw dataset (comma separated value format) has been provided for you to be reused. I'll provide more info on this dataset in the next commits.
