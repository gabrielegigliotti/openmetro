openmetro
=========
Open Data + Milan Metro = OpenMetro
This is just a way to showcase what open data can be used for. Ideally it should be used to represent the whole metro map but I started with the shortest line which is working right now (lilac line or line number 5).

Browser issues
==============
It does not work on Opera and it looks a bit weird in Chrome (labels are far away from the circles representing metro stations). It looks fine on Firefox.

Code issues
===========
It has to be rewritten compltely from the bottom up! :)
